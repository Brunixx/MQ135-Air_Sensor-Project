# MQ135-Air_Sensor-Project
Made for my Physics project, apparently it's related to the movement but I don't see anything but cars in the problem, it's built with C++ language and written in Arduino IDE, I'll soon see to add them a few touches to smooth the decimal places and make some other touches. Also the next IDE I'm going to use the new [Arduino IDE for Chromebooks BETA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.arduino.create_editor) to code it in class :)

## Will it update?
After the overhaul I'll probs deprecate this or well I dunno, this is just a public project and I don't intend to use it after the last update I apply to it.
